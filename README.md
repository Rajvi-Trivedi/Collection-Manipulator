# Student Data Organizer – Collection-Based Record Management System (Python)

## Project Overview

Student Data Organizer is a console-based Python application designed to manage and manipulate student records using core collection data structures.

The system implements structured record handling through lists, dictionaries, and sets within a menu-driven interface, simulating a lightweight student management system.

---

## Objective

This project focuses on:

* Implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Managing structured data using nested collections
* Applying set operations for uniqueness handling
* Designing interactive console-based record systems

---

## Core Functionalities

### Add Student

* Collects student details (ID, Name, Age, Grade, Date of Birth, Subjects)
* Stores records in a dictionary format
* Maintains a dynamic list of student records

### Display Students

* Iterates through stored records
* Displays structured student information

### Update Student

* Searches by unique Student ID
* Allows modification of age and subject data

### Delete Student

* Removes student records using ID

### Display Unique Subjects

* Aggregates subjects across all students
* Uses set operations to ensure uniqueness

### Exit System

* Controlled application termination

---

## Technical Implementation

* Nested data structures (List of Dictionaries)
* Set operations for duplicate removal
* Iterative search logic
* Conditional branching
* Menu-driven console architecture

---

## System Highlights

* Implements record-based system logic
* Demonstrates collection manipulation
* Applies CRUD operation workflow
* Maintains structured data organization
* Simulates a simplified management system

---

## Potential Enhancements

* Add input validation and exception handling
* Improve search efficiency
* Persist data using files or databases
* Modularize into separate functional components
* Convert into GUI or web application
* Introduce authentication and access control
